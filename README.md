# Who am I?

Setting the more existential question aside, I am [Avi Miller](https://omg.dje.li).

During the day, I am a solution architect in the developer adoption team for
[Oracle Cloud Infrastructure](https://cloud.oracle.com). If there is a tool
you use that needs support for or integration with OCI, please let me know!

At night and on weekends, my love for technology extends to annoying my husband
with smart home upgrades as well as more useful stuff like volunteering for
community-based organizations.

## What's here

I am not actually a real developer, but I sometimes pretend to be one on the
internet.

More often I _dabble_. Every so often, I may _noodle_ on things too. The results
of my dabbling and noodling may be found in the various repos herein contained.

I'm particularly proud of two personal things I've dabbled with and noodled on:

* [**homebridge-button-platform**](https://github.com/Djelibeybi/homebridge-button-platform):
  this is a plugin to [Homebridge](https://homebridge.io) that allows you to add
  [Flic buttons](https://omg.dje.li/2020/02/adding-flic-buttons-to-homekit-using-homebridge/)
  or an [Elgato Stream Deck](https://omg.dje.li/2020/05/triggering-homekit-automations-using-an-elgato-stream-deck/)
  to HomeKit.
* [**docker-lifx-daydusk**](https://github.com/Djelibeybi/docker-lifx-daydusk):
   this is a [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/djelibeybi/lifx-daydusk)
   that implements the [LIFX Day & Dusk](https://omg.dje.li/docker-lifx-daydusk/)
   functionality locally without any reliance on the LIFX Cloud. It also provides
   far more granular control of the transitions and bulb selection.

I'm also rather proud of my contributions to [Photons](https://github.com/delfick/photons),
a Python 3.6+ framework for interacting with LIFX products. Photons is used by
the `docker-lifx-daydusk` container.

## What's not here
