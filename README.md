# Who am I?

Setting the more existential question aside, I am [Avi Miller](https://omg.dje.li).

During the day, I do open source things for [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure](https://cloud.oracle.com). 

At night and on weekends, my love for technology extends to annoying my husband
with smart home upgrades as well as more useful stuff like volunteering for
community-based organizations.

## What's here

I am not actually a real developer, but I'm very good at pretending to be one on the
internet.

Mostly I _dabble_. Every now and then I _noodle_ on things too. The results
of my dabbling and noodling can be found in the various repos herein contained.

I'm particularly proud of two personal things I've dabbled with and noodled on:

* [**homebridge-button-platform**](https://github.com/Djelibeybi/homebridge-button-platform):
  this is a plugin to [Homebridge](https://homebridge.io) that allows you to add
  [Flic buttons](https://omg.dje.li/2020/02/adding-flic-buttons-to-homekit-using-homebridge/)
  or an [Elgato Stream Deck](https://omg.dje.li/2020/05/triggering-homekit-automations-using-an-elgato-stream-deck/)
  to HomeKit.
* [**docker-lifx-daydusk**](https://github.com/Djelibeybi/docker-lifx-daydusk):
   this is a [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/djelibeybi/lifx-daydusk)
   that implements the [LIFX Day & Dusk](https://omg.dje.li/docker-lifx-daydusk/)
   functionality locally without any reliance on the LIFX Cloud. It also provides
   far more granular control of the transitions and bulb selection.

I'm also rather proud of my contributions to [Photons](https://github.com/delfick/photons),
a Python 3.6+ framework for interacting with LIFX products. Photons is used by
the `docker-lifx-daydusk` container.

## What's not here

Stuff I maintain professionally for [Oracle](https://opensource.oracle.com) including
the following repos:

* <https://github.com/oracle/centos2ol>

I contribute to the following repos:

* <https://github.com/oracle/vagrant-projects>

I manage the [official Oracle Linux images](https://hub.docker.com/_/oraclelinux)
on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com), 
the [Oracle Container Registry](https://container-registry.oracle.com) and the
[GitHub Container Registry](https://github.com/orgs/oracle/packages)
which are built from the `rootfs` tarballs in this repo:

* <https://github.com/oracle/container-images>

Finally, I am also one of the GitHub administrators for Oracle. If you have any questions
about Oracle's open source projects or contributions, please email the team
at <opensource_ww_grp@oracle.com>.
