# Who am I?

Setting the more existential question aside, I am [Avi Miller](https://omg.dje.li).

During the day, I am an [Oracle Linux](https://www.oracle.com/linux/) product manager at [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com) with a particular focus on [OS Management Hub](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/compute/os-management/) and [Oracle Linux Automation Manager and Engine](https://docs.oracle.com/en/operating-systems/oracle-linux-automation-manager/).

At night and on weekends I'm slowing turning my house into a Makerspace. I have multiple [Bambu Lab](https://github.com/bambulab/) 3D printers including a P1S, X1 Carbon and H2D and more microprocessors and LED strips than I know what to do with, quite frankly. Slowly getting the hang of soldering things too. I have more addressable LEDs in one room than most people have lights in their entire house.

I'm always looking for new ESP32-based blinkenlight projects.

## What's here

I am not actually a real developer, but I'm very good at pretending to be one on the Internet.

Mostly I _dabble_. Every now and then I _noodle_ on things too. The results of my dabbling and noodling can be found in the various repos herein contained.

I'm particularly proud of my contributions to [https://www.home-assistant.io](Home Assistant) and the fact that I'm currently the code owner of the core [LIFX](https://www.lifx.com.au) integration.

I'm also rather proud of my contributions to [Photons](https://github.com/delfick/photons), a Python 3 framework for interacting with LIFX products.

## What's not here

Stuff I maintain professionally for [Oracle](https://opensource.oracle.com). Though, there are a few repos that contain things that are useful to folks who work with or manage some amount of Oracle Linux instances.
