# Who am I?

Setting the more existential question aside, I am [Avi Miller](https://omg.dje.li).

## What's here

I am not actually a real developer, but I'm very good at pretending to be one on the Internet.

Mostly I _dabble_. Every now and then I _noodle_ on things too. The results of my dabbling and noodling can be found in the various repos herein contained.

I'm particularly proud of my contributions to [https://www.home-assistant.io](Home Assistant) and the fact that I'm currently the code owner of the core [LIFX](https://www.lifx.com.au) integration.

I'm also rather proud of my contributions to [Photons](https://github.com/delfick/photons), a Python 3 framework for interacting with LIFX products.
