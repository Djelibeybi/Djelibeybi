# Who am I?

Setting the more existential question aside, I am [Avi Miller](https://omg.dje.li).

During the day, I am a senior manager in the [Oracle Linux and Virtualization](https://oracle.com/linux)
product management team.

At night and on weekends, my love for technology extends to annoying my husband
with smart home upgrades as well as more useful stuff like volunteering for
community-based organizations.

## What's here

I am not developer. I don't even pretend to be one on the internet.

I _dabble_. Every so often, I may _noodle_ on things too. The results of my
dabbling and noodling may be found in the various repos herein contained.

I'm particularly proud of two things I've dabbled with and noodled on:

* [**homebridge-button-platform**](https://github.com/Djelibeybi/homebridge-button-platform):
  this is a plugin to [Homebridge](https://homebridge.io) allows you to add
  [Flic buttons](https://omg.dje.li/2020/02/adding-flic-buttons-to-homekit-using-homebridge/)
  or an [Elgato Stream Deck](https://omg.dje.li/2020/05/triggering-homekit-automations-using-an-elgato-stream-deck/)
  to HomeKit.
* [**docker-lifx-daydusk**](https://github.com/Djelibeybi/docker-lifx-daydusk):
   this is a [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/djelibeybi/lifx-daydusk)
   that implements the [LIFX Day & Dusk](https://omg.dje.li/docker-lifx-daydusk/)
   functionality locally without any reliance on the LIFX Cloud. It also provides
   far more granular control of the transitions and bulb selection.


## What's not here

Stuff I manage professionally. That can be found at <https://github.com/oracle>.

I maintain the following two repos:

* <https://github.com/oracle/docker-images>
* <https://github.com/oracle/linux-labs>

I contribute to the following repos:

* <https://github.com/oracle/vagrant-projects>

I am also one of the GitHub administrators for Oracle. If you have any questions
about Oracle's open source projects or contributions, please email the team
